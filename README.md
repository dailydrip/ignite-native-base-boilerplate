# ignite-native-base-boilerplate v2

This is a fork of
[ignite-native-base-boilerplate](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/ignite-native-base-boilerplate).
We updated dependencies, and our goal is to mantain all the libraries up to date
and add some niceties we are using on Smooth Terminal.

## Quick Start

You can run the following command to create the boilerplate, provided you have [Ignite CLI](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) installed.

```
ignite new appname --boilerplate native-base-boilerplate
```

You can also change the React Native version, just keep in mind, we may not have tested this just yet.

```sh
ignite new appname --react-native-version 0.55 --boilerplate
ignite-smooth-terminal
```

By default we'll ask you some questions during install as to which features you'd like.  If you just want them all, you can skip the questions:

```sh
ignite new appname --max --boilerplate native-base-boilerplate
```

If you want very few of these extras:

```sh
ignite new appname --min --boilerplate native-base-boilerplate
```

### Quick Examples

```
$ ignite add maps
$ ignite add vector-icons
$ ignite generate screen ScreenName
$ ignite generate container ContainerName
$ ignite generate component ComponentName
$ ignite generate list ListName
$ ignite generate map StoreLocator
$ ignite add i18n
$ ignite remove i18n
```


### Demo Examples


```
$ ignite generate screen MyNewScreen
```

```
$ ignite generate container MyNewContainer
```

```
$ ignite generate component MyNewComponent
```
This generates a generic components which is reusable in any screen of the app.
