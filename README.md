This is a fork of
[ignite-native-base-boilerplate](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/ignite-native-base-boilerplate).
We updated dependencies, and our goal is to mantain all the libraries up to date
and add some niceties we are using on Smooth Terminal.

## Quick Start

You can run the following command to create the boilerplate, provided you have [Ignite CLI](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) installed.

```
ignite new appname --boilerplate ignite-smooth-terminal
```

You can also change the React Native version, just keep in mind, we may not have tested this just yet.

```sh
ignite new appname --react-native-version 0.55 --boilerplate ignite-smooth-terminal
```

## Usage with Ignite

By default you can use anything you want from
[Ignite](https://infinite.red/ignite/), including the Ignite Generators.


## Usage with Reactotron

You can use [Reactotron](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron) to help you
debug your app.
